Homework 4, Questions 5.1, 5.3, 5.5, 5.7

Variables for Question 5.1
Xray = monthly xray exposure
BedDays = monthly occupied bed days: 1 bed day if one bed is occupied for entire day
Load (not present) = average daily patient load
Pop (not present)  = eligible population in the area, in thousands
Hours = monthly labor hours (dependent variable)

** Question 5.1 **
(part a)
The 3 largest simple correlation coefficients
between the independent variables are:

cor(Load, BedDays) = 1.0
cor(Pop, Load) = 0.936
cor(Pop, BedDays) = 0.933

The 3 largest Variance Inflation Factors (VIFs) are:

VIF(Load) = 9597.6
VIF(BedDays) = 8933.1
VIF(Pop) = 23.3

(part b)
Based on information from part a, the independent
variables most involved in multicollinearity are
'Load', 'BedDays', and 'Pop'

(part c)
Some of the variables have negative parameter estimates
(Length = -394.3, Load = -15.85, Pop = -4.219)
We would expect these to be positive, as increased length
of patient stay, increased number of patients per day, and
a greater population all logically correspond with higher demand for labor.

(part d)
Yes, the p-value for the f-statistic (given as 0.0001) is much smaller than
that of the individual t-statistics for each variable, the lowest of which
is p-value(Xray) = 0.023

(part e)
Of the two models (model1 = Xray + BedDays + Length,
                   model2 = Xray + BedDays + Pop + Length)
the model with the smallest std. error is model1
the model with the largest R^2 is model2
the model with the smallest value of the C-statistic is model1

the model with the shortest prediction interval (14511, 17618) = 3107
is model1.
The model chosen by stepwise regression and backward elimination is model1.
It seems that model1 is the best model.

** Question 5.3 **
The std. error and adjusted R^2 metrics for the 'optimal model' (as given by the problem
to be the model with 7 variables) are 210.70 and 0.974, respectively.
Comparing with the 'plain' model using only the linear terms TIME, MKTPOTEN, ADVER,
MKTSHARE, the 'plain' model has a std. error of 430.231 and adjusted R^2 of 0.8926

** Question 5.5 **
Figure 5.27 shows a histogram of the residuals, which do not seem to follow a normal
distribution. The distribution does not have a left tail: the left half of
the distribution is approximately as dense as the middle section. The right
side of the distribution is not nearly as dense. It appears the distribution is
skewed to the right. This violates the assumption that the errors are normally
distributed.
The plot of the residuals against the fitted values doesn't seem to show any
particular pattern.
The Normal Probability Plot of the Residuals (with the line fitted to the points)
shows that the residuals that are below zero seem to veer off from the line,
suggesting that the residuals do not follow a normal distribution.

** Question 5.7 **
(part a)
i <- {1..n}
with n = 11
p(i) = ((3i - 1) / (3n + 1)) * 100
so:
	p(4) = ((3(4) - 1) / (3(11) + 1)) * 100
	p(4) = (11 / 34) * 100 = 32.35
similarly:
	p(10) = ((3(10) - 1) / (3(11) + 1)) * 100
	p(10) = (29 / 34) * 100 = 85.29

(part b)
Figure 5.28(c) does not indicate a violation of the normality assumption;
The line forms a tight, linear fit to the residuals, there is strong evidence
that the residuals follow a normal distribution.
