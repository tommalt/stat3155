# Project 1 Summary

We can say, with 95% confidence, that a one unit increase in the variable
'income' (that is, a one unit increase in per capita personal income for the
state, measured in dollars) corresponds with an increase in the mean value of
the response variable (Number of packs of cigarettes sold in the state on a
per capita basis) by some number between 0.0040 and 0.0236 packs.

Here, the value of the intercept in the model has no meaning, because
it is unrealistic that there is 0 dollars per capita personal income
in any one state.

Note that here we have used a filtered portion of the data (removing outliers)
When using the full dataset, we achieve similar results: the confidence interval
is (0.0029, 0.0322) instead of (0.0040, 0.0236). The meaning of this interval
is the same as stated above.
