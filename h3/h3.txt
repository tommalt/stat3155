Problem 4.3

The estimates for b0, b1, and b2 are 29.3468, 5.6128, and 3.8344, respectively.

The estimate for b0 means that the average value of the response variable
(SalesPrice / 1000) is about 29.3468 (or $29,346.8) when the HomeSize = 0
and Rating = 0. This has no meaning, because it does not make sense to have a
home of size 0.

The estimate for b1 (5.613) means that the average value of the response variable
(SalesPrice / 1000) increases by a factor of 5.613 for a one unit increase
in (HomeSize / 100), ceteris paribus. In other words, an increase in HomeSize
of 100ft^2 leads to an increase in average SalesPrice by $5,613.

The estimate for b2 (3.834) means that the average value of the response variable
(SalesPrice / 1000) increases by a factor of 3.834 for a one unit increase
in Rating, ceteris paribus. In other words, an increase in Rating
of 1 leads to an increase in average SalesPrice by $3,834.

For a home size of 2000ft^2 (x1 = 20) and Rating of 8 (x2 = 8), the predicted
value of the response (SalesPrice / 1000) is 172.2783, or $172,278.3

Problem 4.4

The estimates for b0, b1, b2, and b3 are
1946.80204, 0.03858, 1.03939, and -413.75780 respectively

The value b0 (1523.38924) means that when all other variables are = 0,
the average value (mean) of the response (Labor) is about 1523.38924
This means nothing to us because if there are no patients to serve
(i.e. Xrays, Occupied beds, and Length of stay all == 0), then there
is no need for labor.

The values b[i] mean that for a one unit increase in x[i], the
average value (mean) of the response (Labor) increases by a factor
of b[i], ceteris paribus, for i <- {i..k} with k = number of variables
in the model (in this case, 3).

The point prediction (yhat) is 16,064.544777331
The true value (y) is given as 17,207.31 
The residual y - yhat         = 1,142.755222
